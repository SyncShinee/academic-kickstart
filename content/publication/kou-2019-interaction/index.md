abstract: "The last decade has witnessed the emergence and popularity of event-based social networks (EBSNs), which extend online social networks to the physical world. Fundamental onEBSN platforms is to appropriately assign EBSN users to events they are interested to attend, known as event-participant arrangement. Previous event-participant arrangement studies either fail to avoid conflicts among events or ignore the social interactions among participants. In this work, we propose a new event-participant arrangement problem called Interaction-awareGlobal Event-Participant Arrangement (IGEPA). It globally optimizes arrangements between events and participants to avoid conflicts in events, and not only accounts for user interests, but also encourages socially active participants to join. To solve theIGEPA problem, we design an approximation algorithm which has an approximation ratio of at least 1/4. Experimental result s validate the effectiveness of our solution."
