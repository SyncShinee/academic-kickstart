abstract: "With spatial crowdsourcing applications such as
Uber and Waze deeply penetrated into everyday life, there is a
growing concern to protect user privacy in spatial crowdsourcing.
Particularly, locations of workers and tasks should be properly
processed via certain privacy mechanism before reporting to
the untrusted spatial crowdsourcing server for task assignment.
Privacy mechanisms typically permute the location information,
which tends to make task assignment ineffective. Prior studies
only provide guarantees on privacy protection without assuring
the effectiveness of task assignment. In this paper, we investigate
privacy protection for online task assignment with the objective
of minimizing the total distance, an important task assignment
formulation in spatial crowdsourcing. We design a novel privacy mechanism based on Hierarchically Well-Separated Trees
(HSTs). We prove that the mechanism is $\\epsilon$-Geo-Indistinguishable
and show that there is a task assignment algorithm with a
competitive ratio of $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^4} \\log N \\log^2 k)$ , where is the privacy
budget, N is the number of predefined points on the HST, and
k is the matching size. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real datasets show that online task assignment under our privacy
mechanism is notably more effective in terms of total distance
than under prior differentially private mechanisms."
