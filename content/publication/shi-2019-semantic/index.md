abstract: "General-purpose topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are widely used in industrial applications. However, conventional topic
models usually lack data privacy protection mechanisms. This has become a serious issue since industrial data are often sensitive and new policies such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enforce protection of sensitive data. To solve this problem, we propose a novel privacy preserving general-purpose topic model named Private and Consistent Topic Discovery (PC-TD). On the one hand, PC-TD seamlessly integrates differential privacy, a popular privacy preserving technique, to provide privacy guarantees. On the other hand, PC-TD exploits multiple sources of semantic consistency information to retain the accuracy of topic modeling while protecting data privacy. We verify the effectiveness of PC-TD on real-life datasets. Experimental results show its superiority over the state-of-the-art general-purpose topic models."
